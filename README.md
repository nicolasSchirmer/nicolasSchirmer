# 0x00 :  Hello World! 

Hey! ðŸ¥¸ðŸ¤™

My name is Nicolas and I'm a Brazilian ~~developer~~.... ~~security engineer~~... ~~pentester~~... ~~architect~~.... ~~reverse engineer~~... **problem solver**.

> I've started coding since I was 10yo, lern by my self without any support for it and created at that time a Windows XP Malware with Basic to mess up remotely the sys32 structure. Since that age I've never stoped learning computer coding and attack vectors.
